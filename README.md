For this app, please also list what you learned from developing this app.
This is the first time I used Android Studio. I think this software is very convinient for those who are new to android development, setup the java environment and the whole emulator stuff will spend a lot of time and it's frustrating. Android Studio definitely saves a lot of time for us.
